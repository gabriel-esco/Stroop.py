# Stroop.py
The ‘Stroop Effect’, first described in 1935 by American psychologist John Ridley Stroop, describes the difference in 
reaction/processing times between sets of congruent and incongruent stimuli. This effect, being incredibly popular 
in the field of neuropsychology, is best demonstrated through the famous ‘Stroop Color and Word Test’, or SCWT for short. 
In this experiment, a participant is presented with two lists of words, the first list containing words that are printed in 
a color congruent with the meaning of the word (word ‘green’ is printed in green ink), and the second list has containing 
words that are printed in a different color than the meaning of the word (word ‘red’ printed in blue ink). Participants are 
then told to say, out loud, the color that a word is printed in.

As the term project for my Statistics course, my team and I set out to measure the Stroop Effect using a fully digital environment. 
As such, I created Stroop.py to automate the process of measuring the Stroop Effect.
